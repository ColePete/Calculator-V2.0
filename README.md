This is a standard 4 function calculator for all to use for their math. 

**DISCLAIMER:** I am sure that others have made this before. I did not copy them, I made this all by myself.  

Also, if you are going to do a multi-equation problem
(EX: 4 + 2 + 6 - 2) then you need to do it one at a time for now. 
(EX: 4 + 2 = 6 then 6 + 6 = 12 then 12 - 2 = 10  ) 

There are no known bugs *yet* but please let me know if you find one.
